Kubernetes
-----------
how to deploy, use, maintain in cluster

Origin of k8
-------------
traditional deplymnt

diff applictn running on same server
it takes all resources for 1 applictn

VM intoduced
virtualization deploymnt

high cost
security tisk
availability issue
Limitations and restictions
Time consuming

deiff b/w k8 qnd vm
--------------------

vm --not secured
not easily portable
time is more
less isolation
wait time is more


k8--secured
portable
time is less
better isolation shares os among the resources
saves much time


what is k8
-----------
open source
use to maintaining and deploying a group of containers
k8+docker
google initially developed k9
201 to run on cloud architecure made covinent

Benifits
---------
9-key

portable 100%
workload scalability
high availability
design for deployment
service discovery and LoadBal
Storage Orchestration(ssd)
self healing --some thing fails restart the process
automated rollout and rollback
Automatic bin packing

Installation
-------------
sudo apt get update
enter password
sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https
sudo apt install docker.io
yes
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
sudo apt-get install curl
sudo curl -s  key.. sudo aot-key add
sudo chmode 777/etc/apt/resources.list.d/
sudo apt-get update

kubernetes components
--
sudo apt-get install -y kubelet kubeadm kubectl kubernetes-cni

sudo swapoff -add 
sudo kubedem initi

start cluster 

sudo kubectl apply -f xxxx.yaml
sudo kubectl get pods


K8 terminologies
-----------------
6 terminologies

cluster -- set of vm(physcl/virtual)

Node-- they are worker machines that run containerized applications  

Pod-- it is a groupof containers that are deployed together on the same host

replication contollers-- it is used to definr pod lifecycles, rather than to create pods directly

Selector--expression matches lables to filter specific resources

Labels--they are key-value pairs, that are attached to objects

replication sets --they define how many replicas of each pod will running

Annotation--it is a label with much larger data capacity

Name--a name by resource is identified

Volume--directory with data which is accessible to a containerized

NAmespace--provides additinal qualifictn to a resource name

Service==abstarction on top of pods, provides single ip address abd DNS name by which pods are accessed
